# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# We don't really need this seed data since our development is already seeded
# with info from our csv_load terminal commands. But we can use this for our
# spec tests

# InvoiceItem.destroy_all
# Item.destroy_all
# Merchant.destroy_all
# Transaction.destroy_all
# Invoice.destroy_all
# Customer.destroy_all
